### 1.1 Responsive Web Design 
#### 1.1.1 CSS @media query
> The @media rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices

Started with small screens first and worked up.

    /* smartphones */ 
    @media screen and (min-width : 0px)
    /* iPhones 6/7/8 plus */
    @media screen and (min-width : 414px)
    /* iPads */
    @media screen and (min-width : 768px)
